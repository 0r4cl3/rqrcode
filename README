= rQRCode, Encode QRCodes

rQRCode is a library for encoding QR Codes in Ruby. It has a simple interface with all the standard qrcode options. It was adapted from the Javascript library by Kazuhiko Arase.

= An Overview

Let's clear up what rQRCode is.

# rQRCode is a *standalone library*. It requires no other libraries. Just Ruby!
# It is an encoding library. You can't decode QR codes with it.
# The interface is simple and assumes you just want to parse a string into a QR code
# QR code is trademarked by Denso Wave inc
